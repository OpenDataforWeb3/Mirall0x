# Mirall0x

The Mirall0x app is an open source project, developed to empower communities when analyzing candidates for grants. It uses on-chain and off-chain metadata to deliver quality information in a centralized and visual way for key decision making.

## How does it work?    
Broadly, it is built on top of the concept of Legos for sybil analysis, a concept developed by the former Gitcoin's Fraud Detection and Defense Workstream and the [OpenData Community](https://opendatacommunity.org/). An more detailed explanation on Legos can be found [here](https://opendatacommunity.org/docs/legos). 
Mirall0x extracts project data from third party services, treats this data and performs the first layers of calculations. Utilizing ‘weights’ inputted by the user for each ‘behavior’ of a set of projects, it performs a second layer of calculations resulting in scores for each behavior and generating an overall score. By the end, projects are displayed in a 3D scatterplot positioned by their score results to help the user to better visualize ‘riskier’ projects that could be prioritized for further analysis. Optionally, Mirall0x provides a CSV file with the Legos results and the scores according to the weights given by the user.

# Mirall0x

Mirall0x app is an open source project developed to empower communities when analyzing candidates for grants. It uses  on-chain and off-chain metadata to deliver quality information in a centralized and visual way for key decision making.  

For an explanation of one of the main use cases and a demo of the current app version check this video :

## How does it work?  
  

Broadly, It is built on top of the concept of Legos for sybil analysis, a concept developed by the former Gitcoin's Fraud Detection and Defense Workstream and the OpenData Community. Further explanation on legos here. 
MIrall0x extracts project  data from third party services, treats this data and performs the first layers of calculations. Utilizing ‘weights’ imputed by the user for each ‘behavior’ of a set of  projects, it performs a second layer of calculations resulting in scores for each behavior  and generating an overall score. By the end, projects are displayed in a 3D scatterplot positioned by their score results  to help the user to better visualize ‘riskier’ projects that could be prioritized for further analysis. Optionally, mirall0x provides a CSV file with the legos results and the scores according to  the imputed weights given by the user.
